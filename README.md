I have developed a separate, well-structured admin dashboard for my eCommerce website. The dashboard is designed to efficiently manage orders and includes functionalities for receiving and processing them. Within the dashboard, orders are categorized into different statuses: Pending, Success, and Deleted. Administrators have the ability to update the status of each order accordingly.

The login credentials for the admin panel are as follows:

Email: hamzakhan.hk1994@gmail.com
Password: hamzazxc
This dashboard enhances order management by providing a clear overview of all transactions and their current status.
